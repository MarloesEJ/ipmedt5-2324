## Introduction hardware:
### part one:
    add two leds to one port, make them blink. When one is on the other is off.
    the leds blink on an frequency
    the frequency is set with a rotary encoder between 0.25 Hz to 100 Hz
    one click CW adds to the frequency, one click CCW subtracts from the frequency
    the frequency is shown on the serial monitor
    the pushbutton on the rotary encoder stops and starts the blinking of the leds, when it stops the led that was on stays on.
    No delay is used
